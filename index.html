                    Incomplete (IN) grades are given only as specified in university regulations.  Students who wish to audit the course with satisfactory status must register officially for the course and will be required to attend all class meetings and take both midterm exams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>In Class Activities</h3>
                    This course is taught in student centered manner.  During lecture periods students will complete activities and exercises that illustrate course content.  The instructor will randomly select activities to grade and students will receive points accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Homework</h3>
                    Homework will be due every Friday at midnight (11:59PM).  Homework assignments will be delivered through WebAssign.  Each assignment will be available Saturday at 8:00AM the week before it is due.  Study guides for each assignment will be posted on the course web site.  Students are encouraged to review the study guide before beginning each assignment.  Extensions will not be granted on homework assignments.  Any assignment not submitted on time will receive a zero.  Twelve assignments will be given and the lowest two (including missed assignments) will be dropped.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Exams</h3>
                    Exams will be closed book, closed notes. A formula sheet will be provided and is posted on the course website.  You should bring your own calculator. All cell phones, PDAs and any web-enabled devices must be turned off and put away during tests. These devices can NOT be used as calculators or time keeping devices during the test. Students may NOT share calculators during exams. Students may NOT leave the room and return for any reason during an exam.  Requests for re-grading of exams must be submitted in writing to the instructor.
                    <br /><br />
                    Students who are unable to attend an exam for a legitimate unavoidable reason may take a make-up exam only if the student provides suitable documentation of the absence.  According to university policy, a student must notify the instructor in advance if s/he will miss an exam. If it is not possible to notify the instructor in advance, the instructor must be given notice as soon as possible after the exam. Make-up exams will be given at a single time (to be announced) and will be common to all sections.
